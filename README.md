D-Pong
======

This is a pong clone I made in the D programming language. It requires derelict and SDL to properly build.

A MS Visual Studio solution is provided, with the lastest source associated with this game. 

To Play the game, navigate to the bin folder and run the DPong.exe file. This program has only been tested on 
Windows Vista and Windows 7.
